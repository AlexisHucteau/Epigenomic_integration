# **Epigenomic_integration**
DNA methylation, transcription, chromatin conformation integration

## DATA required

### DNA methylation's data
Beta-values

### Transcription's data
Counts

## Different step in the analysis

* I Differential methylation analysis
  * Make different comparison and find CpGs differentially methylated for each comparison

* II Differential transcription analysis
  * Make different comparison and find Genes differentially expressed for each comparison

* III Create 3D chromatin conformation
  * Filter a 3D chromatin conformation based on a defined cell line with a defined level of weight of interaction

* IV Spatial association
  * Associate Genes the coordinates of their promoter.
  * Associate CpGs to
